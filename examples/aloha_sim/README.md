## Recording and interpreting π₀-FAST action tokens

This workflow runs the `pi0_fast_base` checkpoint through ALOHA sim and records, for
every policy inference, the **raw discrete action tokens** the model generates — so you
can inspect what π₀-FAST actually emits before (and after) FAST decoding.

### What it does

`pi0_fast` does not output continuous actions directly. It autoregressively generates a
sequence of PaliGemma vocabulary tokens; the action-carrying ones live near the top of
the vocabulary and are mapped back to **FAST token IDs** via:

```
fast_token_id = 257152 - 1 - 128 - paligemma_token_id   (= 257023 - paligemma_token_id)
```

That FAST token sequence is then decoded (inverse-BPE + inverse-DCT) into a continuous
action chunk of shape `[action_horizon, action_dim]` (here `[32, 32]`); for ALOHA only the
first 14 dims are robot-relevant.

When logging is enabled, the `ExtractFASTActions` output transform
([src/openpi/transforms.py](../../src/openpi/transforms.py)) writes one JSON object per
inference to a JSONL file. **Each record is one inference call = one action chunk (a short
series of `action_horizon` planned timesteps), not a single timestep.** A record carries a
`record_index` (order within the run), `time_unix` / `time_iso` (wall-clock timestamp at
the start of that record), the raw PaliGemma token IDs, the converted FAST token IDs,
`decode_ok`/`decode_error`, the decoded action shape, `decoded_all_zero`, and — for the
movement analyses — `decoded_actions` / `aloha_actions_14d` / `state`. Decode failures are
caught so the policy server stays alive — useful because `pi0_fast_base` is *not* fine-tuned
for ALOHA sim and routinely emits FAST sequences that fail to decode (they appear as
`decode_ok: false`, `decoded_all_zero: true`).

### 1. Run the sim and record tokens

The server reads two variables, forwarded into the `openpi_server` container by
[compose.yml](compose.yml): `SERVER_ARGS` (which config/checkpoint to serve) and
`OPENPI_FAST_TOKEN_LOG` (where to write the token log; `/app` inside the container is the
repo root on the host, so it lands in `./data`). Set them one of two ways.

**Option A — `.env` file (persists across logins; recommended).** A ready-made
[examples/aloha_sim/.env](.env) is provided and Compose auto-loads it (its project
directory defaults to the compose file's directory). It is gitignored, so if you cloned
fresh and it's missing, create it with:

```bash
cat > examples/aloha_sim/.env <<'EOF'
SERVER_ARGS=policy:checkpoint --policy.config=pi0_fast_aloha_sim --policy.dir=gs://openpi-assets/checkpoints/pi0_fast_base
OPENPI_FAST_TOKEN_LOG=/app/data/aloha_sim/token_logs/pi0_fast_tokens.jsonl
EOF
```

With the `.env` in place you can skip straight to the `docker compose` command below.

**Setting the simulation length.** The number of logged records is roughly
`max_episode_steps / action_horizon` (the broker's `action_horizon` is 10), so 200 steps
≈ 20 records; the default (0) runs a full episode (~30 records). There are two ways to set
it, depending on how you launch:

- **Docker (env var).** Set `ALOHA_MAX_EPISODE_STEPS` — it is forwarded into the runtime
  container by [compose.yml](compose.yml) and read by [main.py](main.py). Put it in the
  `.env` (already set to `200` there) or pass it inline for a one-off:

  ```bash
  ALOHA_MAX_EPISODE_STEPS=400 docker compose -f examples/aloha_sim/compose.yml up --build
  ```

- **Without Docker (CLI flag).** `main.py` also exposes a `--max-episode-steps` argument.
  The Docker container's CMD is hardcoded with no args, so this flag only applies when you
  run `main.py` directly (see the "Without Docker" section above):

  ```bash
  MUJOCO_GL=egl python examples/aloha_sim/main.py --max-episode-steps 200
  ```

**Option B — export in your shell (per session).** `export`ed variables are lost when you
log out, so you must re-run these (and they override the `.env` if both are set):

```bash
export SERVER_ARGS="policy:checkpoint --policy.config=pi0_fast_aloha_sim --policy.dir=gs://openpi-assets/checkpoints/pi0_fast_base"
export OPENPI_FAST_TOKEN_LOG=/app/data/aloha_sim/token_logs/pi0_fast_tokens.jsonl

# Confirm they are set BEFORE launching (a common failure is an empty/forgotten export):
echo "SERVER_ARGS=$SERVER_ARGS"
echo "OPENPI_FAST_TOKEN_LOG=$OPENPI_FAST_TOKEN_LOG"
```

**Then build and run:**

```bash
# Start fresh — the log is opened in append mode, so remove any previous run's file.
rm -f data/aloha_sim/token_logs/pi0_fast_tokens.jsonl

# Build and run. The server prints "[OPENPI_FAST_TOKEN_LOG] active -> ..." on the first
# decode, confirming the logger is wired up. The episode runs to completion even when
# FAST decoding fails, and the video is saved to data/aloha_sim/videos/out_*.mp4.
docker compose -f examples/aloha_sim/compose.yml up --build
```

### 2. Quick sanity check on the log

```bash
# How many steps were logged.
wc -l data/aloha_sim/token_logs/pi0_fast_tokens.jsonl

# Count genuine decode successes vs. failures.
grep -o '"decode_ok": [a-z]*' data/aloha_sim/token_logs/pi0_fast_tokens.jsonl | sort | uniq -c

# Count steps whose decoded actions were an all-zero fallback (i.e. FAST decode failed
# internally and returned zeros of the correct shape).
grep -o '"decoded_all_zero": [a-z]*' data/aloha_sim/token_logs/pi0_fast_tokens.jsonl | sort | uniq -c
```

### 3. Produce human-readable summaries

[interpret_fast_tokens.py](../../interpret_fast_tokens.py) reads the JSONL and emits
per-record and aggregate summaries plus optional CSV/plots.

```bash
uv run python interpret_fast_tokens.py \
  --input data/aloha_sim/token_logs/pi0_fast_tokens.jsonl \
  --output-dir interpreted_tokens --csv --plots --print-records 5
```

What the flags do:

- `--input` — path to the JSONL token log to read.
- `--output-dir` — where to write outputs (default `interpreted_tokens/`).
- `--csv` — also write `records.csv` (one row per inference step).
- `--plots` — also write PNGs (decode-success-over-time, FAST-token-count per record,
  ALOHA action L2 norm over time, and per-record ALOHA action heatmaps). Requires
  matplotlib; no seaborn.
- `--print-records N` — print compact one-line summaries for the first `N` records.
- `--max-records N` — (optional) only process the first `N` records.

Each record is identified by the `record_index` and `time_unix` / `time_iso` (UTC) that
`ExtractFASTActions` writes — the order and wall-clock start of each inference. The tool
uses those logged values when present (and falls back to positional index / derived ISO for
older logs), so `--print-records` shows `Record <i> @ <time_iso>` and `records.csv` carries
both `time_unix` and `time_iso` columns.

Outputs written to `--output-dir`:

- `summary.json` — aggregate stats (decode success rate, avg FAST token count, most common
  FAST tokens, failed/all-zero record indices, overall top-moving ALOHA dims).
- `fast_tokens.txt` — the filtered FAST action-token IDs, one line per record.
- `records.csv` — per-record table (`record_index`, `time_unix`, `time_iso`, token counts,
  decode flags, action/ALOHA stats).
- `*.png` — the plots, when `--plots` is passed.

The script also prints the aggregate summary to stdout. Note: ALOHA motion statistics only
appear if the log records the decoded continuous actions; the default record stores
`decoded_actions_shape` but not the values. To populate the action-level stats, add the
arrays to the record in `ExtractFASTActions`:

```python
record["decoded_actions"] = actions.tolist()           # full [32, 32] chunk
record["aloha_actions_14d"] = actions[:, :14].tolist()  # robot-relevant dims
record["state"] = data["state"].tolist()                # optional: current pose
```

then re-run steps 1–3.

### 4. Understand whether/where the robot moves

A FAST token does **not** map to a single joint or timestep: the encoder runs a DCT
along time (mixing all timesteps) and then BPE-compresses across dimensions (mixing all
joints). So "which token moves which joint" is not recoverable from tokens directly — the
movement lives in the *decoded continuous chunk* `[32, 14]`, where the 14 ALOHA dims are
(verified against [aloha_policy.py](../../src/openpi/policies/aloha_policy.py)):

| dims  | robot part            |
| ----- | --------------------- |
| 0–5   | left arm joints 1–6   |
| 6     | left gripper          |
| 7–12  | right arm joints 1–6  |
| 13    | right gripper         |

`interpret_fast_tokens.py` provides two independent analyses for this, each behind its own
flag (run either, both, or neither):

#### Analysis 1 — token-only motion proxy (`--token-motion`)

A **decode-free** estimate that works on *any* log, including failed/all-zero decodes.
FAST is a frequency-domain code: a near-still trajectory has energy only in the DC
coefficient, quantizes to long zero-runs, and BPE compresses those into few, highly
repeated tokens — while a moving trajectory excites more frequencies and produces a
longer, more diverse token stream. The tool therefore uses **normalized token entropy**
(0–1) as a whole-chunk proxy for motion and labels each record `still` / `low` / `active`.
This is coarse and **not per-joint**, but it lets you rank steps by likely activity even
when decoding fails.

```bash
uv run python interpret_fast_tokens.py \
  --input data/aloha_sim/token_logs/pi0_fast_tokens.jsonl \
  --token-motion --motion-print 10
```

Prints a per-record table (proxy, unique-token ratio, dominant token) plus an aggregate
label breakdown, and writes `token_motion.csv`. Tunables: `--motion-print N` controls how
many per-record lines are shown.

#### Analysis 2 — per-joint movement (`--joint-motion`)

A **quantitative, per-joint** analysis computed from the *decoded* continuous actions, so
it requires the `decoded_actions` (or `aloha_actions_14d`) field described above to be in
the log. ALOHA actions here are absolute joint positions, so motion is measured as
variation across the 32-step chunk: a joint is flagged **moving** when its peak-to-peak
range exceeds `--joint-move-threshold`. For each chunk it reports which named joints move,
whether the chunk is static (holds pose), per-timestep step deltas, and — if you also log
`state` — how far the commanded chunk departs from the current pose. An aggregate table
shows which joints move most often across the run.

```bash
uv run python interpret_fast_tokens.py \
  --input data/aloha_sim/token_logs/pi0_fast_tokens.jsonl \
  --joint-motion --joint-move-threshold 0.02 --motion-print 10
```

Writes `joint_motion.json` (full per-record detail) and `joint_motion.csv` (per-record
summary). If no decoded actions are present, the section prints exactly which fields to add
to `ExtractFASTActions` and exits gracefully.

#### Per-timestep action mapping (`--per-timestep`)

For the finest-grained view, this writes **one CSV per decoded chunk** mapping every
timestep to its 14 named joint values, the step delta from the previous timestep, the
`relevant_joints` that changed by more than `--joint-move-threshold` at that timestep, and
(if `state` is logged) the distance from the current pose. This answers "at timestep *t*,
which joints actually move and by how much." It needs decoded actions in the log, same as
Analysis 2.

```bash
uv run python interpret_fast_tokens.py \
  --input data/aloha_sim/token_logs/pi0_fast_tokens.jsonl \
  --joint-motion --per-timestep --joint-move-threshold 0.01
```

Files are written to `<output-dir>/per_timestep/record_<i>.csv`. Note the threshold is
applied two ways: Analysis 2 flags a joint as "moving" by its **peak-to-peak** range over
the whole chunk, while `relevant_joints` here uses the **step-to-step** delta — so a joint
that drifts slowly can be chunk-level "moving" yet rarely "relevant" at any single step.

> **Note on units:** the logged `decoded_actions` are model-space (normalized) values,
> captured before the downstream Unnormalize/AlohaOutputs transforms. Relative motion
> (which joints vary, and when) is faithful; absolute magnitudes are in normalized units,
> not radians.

> **Heads-up:** with un-finetuned `pi0_fast_base` on ALOHA sim, decoding fails or returns
> garbage for most steps, so Analysis 2's numbers are not yet meaningful — use Analysis 1
> (which works regardless) until you have a checkpoint fine-tuned for this embodiment.
